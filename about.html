        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently a PhD student at Trinity College Dublin, working in Prof. Graham Cross' Nanomechanics Group. Over the past
             9 years, I have researched and studied various surface science subjects related to small-scale contacts.
              This began with experimental efforts using scanning tunnelling microscopes (STMs) and atomic force microscopes (AFMs), 
              and progressed to nanoindentation over undergrad and master studies in Istanbul Technical University under Prof. H. Ozgur Ozer's supervision. 
              Currently, my research focuses on the lubrication of 2D materials and the interfacial shear strength of contacts, using 
              a special dual-axis nanoindenter.

            <h3>Out of the lab</h3>
            <p>
                I am someone who loves to keep busy! When I am not in the lab, I usually spend my time poring over data or diving into 
                research papers. However, I also have some fun hobbies that are not related to work. I enjoy swimming and exploring new 
                suburban areas to meet new people. If I can spare time, I like to create models of engineering stuff and experiment with 
                new designs (which are often called "maker" nowadays). As a not-very-talented musician, I have been trying to play a 
                traditional flute called "ney". And, of course, I am always reading a couple of books.
